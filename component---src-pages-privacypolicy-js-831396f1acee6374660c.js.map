It is further agreed that, subject to the limitations\n                  imposed by the Arbitration Act, 1991, such arbitration shall\n                  be a condition precedent to the commencement of any action at\n                  law other than actions seeking only equitable relief.

Subject to any limitations imposed\n                  by the arbitrator, all parties shall have the right to be\n                  present at the arbitration. Subject to the other provisions of\n                  this section, the procedures to be followed shall be agreed by\n                  the parties or, in default of agreement, determined by the\n                  arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to proceed\n                  with the arbitration and to deliver an award notwithstanding\n                  the default by any party in respect of any procedural order\n                  made by the arbitrator. Subject to a determination by the\n                  arbitrator, all notices and statements shall not be required\n                  to be in a specific form, but shall substantially comply with\n                  the requirements and intention of this section. Subject to an\n                  award made by the arbitrator, all parties shall share the fees\n                  and expenses of the arbitrator equally. Statute of\n                  Limitations.
